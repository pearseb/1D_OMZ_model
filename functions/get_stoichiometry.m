 function bgc = get_stochiometry(bgc,a,b,c,d)

% Calculates the stochiometry of various redox reactions given the
% composition of organic matter i.e., (C_a)(H_b)(O_c)(N_d)(P)

% Number of electrons required to oxidize (C_a)(H_b)(O_c)(N_d)(P) to CO2 +
% NH3 + H2O + H3PO4
 Corg_e = 4*a+b-2*c-3*d+5;
 
% Number of electrons required to reduce O2 to H2O
 O2toH2O_e = 4;

% number of electrons required to reduce HNO3 to HNO2
 HNO3toHNO2_e = 2;
 
% Number of electrons required to reduce HNO2 to N2O ---> Need to check b/c # of N atoms changes
 HNO2toN2O_e = 2;
 
% Number of electrons required to reduce N2O to N2
 N2OtoN2_e = 2;
