 Flowchart to run a series of optimizations:

 - Change the name of optimization $Optim in:
   optimize_cmaes.m
   note that by default compile script uses "optimize_cmaes.m" from current folder
   but this can be changed within the compile script
 - Change name of basedir $Optim (same name) in:
   compile_script.m
 - Change any part of the code e.g. "bgc1d_fc2minimize_evaluate_cost.m"
   in the main code folder (specified in compilation script) as this is the
   code that is going to be used for the optimization series
 - Run "compile_script.m" in Matlab in the "compile/" folder 
   compile_script
   This will generate a local folder $Optim/optimize_cmaes/
   contianing all the fucntions and files for running and compiling
   Matlab will also generate the compilation command
 - Do any changes to files under $Optim/optimize_cmaes/ before compiling
   e.g. need to comment all "addpath" instances for safety 
   follow the instruction prompted by matlab command line
   NOTE: to use local files, make sure "cost function" doesnt use long paths 
 - Run compilation command (copy and paste from command line):
   mcc -m -R -nosplash optimize_cmaes.m ...
 - TO RUN INTERACTIVELY
   ./optimize_cmaes > logfile.txt
 - TO RUN MULTIPLE JOBS AS BATCH
   change the $Optim name in 
   runMultiMatlab.sb
   to match name in optimize_cmaes.m and compile_script.m
   Change the indices of the runs e.g. to run 50 runs use:
   "for i in {1..50..1}"
   Submit code:
   ./runMultiMatlab.sb
   This will generate a bunch of runscript for a series of optimizations
   and automatically submit them to the queue
 - When done, move the series of runscripts into the $Optname/runscript/ folder
   for cleaniness
